All of which are supported, yet not limited to data visualization, modeling, and storytelling.\n Achieving business objectives is just as, if not, more important than the advanced methods or technology employed to influence business decisions.\n Whenever you need something to be built from GROUND ZERO, I am usually the one to talk to.\n",
